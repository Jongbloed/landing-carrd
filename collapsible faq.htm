Our work has the potential to reshape your personality for maximum mental wellness, by exploring where it got shaped (in childhood) and working up from there.<br/> That means lasting change. We know that surface-level issues like negative self talk, low self-worth and anxiety stem from unresolved trauma. <br/>To achieve lasting change, we will have to go quite a bit deeper than your run-of-the-mill “tips & tricks” and superficial affirmations-based feel good approaches you might find in other courses. The advantage of that is it not only solves your surface level issue, but also transforms you into the person you always felt you could be. <br/>The downside is that you have to be up for the "real work" - it can be emotionally challenging. If you\'re used to self-helpy things like "replacing negative thoughts by more positive ones", this will open up a whole new world to you, and I hope you\'re ready.<br/> This is the kind of change that affects other areas of life too. Although we make no such promises, it\’s not uncommon for clients to suddenly have a “lucky” break in their career, or seem to have become much more attractive to the other sex, after doing the exercises in Inner Alchemists for some time.',

It is an asymmetrical relationship, you submit yourself to a professional whose experience you trust. Then you can go to integrate and deepen those insights further with an Inner Alchemists member, enjoying a mutual relationship: you facilitate for each other using the simple proven steps, and the power dynamic is balanced. The advantage to therapy is that you can benefit from years of experience. The advantage to Inner Alchemists is you get 80% of the benefits of therapy, through crowdsourcing human intuition with a mutual relationship and while making real connections with like-minded people. We recommend doing both. Many of our members have 1-on-1 sessions with a therapist as well.',
